To merge the "drop-off date" and "pick-up date" into a single "date" node, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Data Structure**: Determine how the "drop-off date" and "pick-up date" are currently represented in your data structure (e.g., JSON, XML, database).

2. **Create a New Node**: Define a new node called "date" that will hold the values of both "drop-off date" and "pick-up date".

3. **Combine the Dates**: Depending on your requirements, you can either:
   - Store both dates in an array or object within the "date" node.
   - Choose one of the dates to represent the "date" node, if only one is needed.

4. **Update References**: Ensure that any references to the old "drop-off date" and "pick-up date" are updated to point to the new "date" node.

5. **Test the Changes**: Verify that the new structure works as intended and that all functionalities relying on these dates are still operational.

### Example

If you have a JSON structure like this:

```json
{
  "drop-off date": "2023-10-01",
  "pick-up date": "2023-10-05"
}
```

You can merge it into:

```json
{
  "date": {
    "drop-off": "2023-10-01",
    "pick-up": "2023-10-05"
  }
}
```

Or, if you only need one date:

```json
{
  "date": "2023-10-01"  // or "2023-10-05" based on your requirement
}
```

Make sure to adjust your application logic accordingly to handle the new structure.
