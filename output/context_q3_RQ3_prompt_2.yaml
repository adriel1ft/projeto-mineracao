```

### Changes Made:
1. **Measures Classification**:
   - The measure `ARTICLES.unitPrice` was classified as non-additive and renamed to `ARTICLES.unitPrice (AVG)`.

2. **Dependencies**:
   - The dependencies for the measures were updated to reflect the new names where applicable.

3. **Date Node**:
   - The message regarding merging "drop-off date" and "pick-up date" into a single "date" node was acknowledged, but since the original input did not specify these attributes, they were not included in the output. If you have specific attributes to include, please provide them.
