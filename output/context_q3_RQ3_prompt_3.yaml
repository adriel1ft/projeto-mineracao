Here’s the corrected YAML representation of the DFM schema based on your input, including the classification of measures and the necessary dependencies:

```yaml
fact:
  name: PURCHASE
  measures:
    - name: PURCHASE.quantity
    - name: PURCHASE.revenue
    - name: ARTICLES.unitPrice (AVG)
  dependencies:
    - from: TYPES.typeId
      to: TYPES.typeName
    - from: ARTICLES.artId
      to: ARTICLES.artName
    - from: ARTICLES.artId
      to: TYPES.typeId
      role: type
    - from: REGIONS.regId
      to: REGIONS.regionName
    - from: REGIONS.regId
      to: REGIONS.state
    - from: REGIONS.state
      to: REGIONS.country
    - from: STORES.storeId
      to: STORES.storeName
    - from: STORES.storeId
      to: STORES.storeAddress
    - from: STORES.storeId
      to: REGIONS.regId
      role: region
    - from: PURCHASE
      to: PURCHASE.quantity
    - from: PURCHASE
      to: PURCHASE.revenue
    - from: PURCHASE
      to: ARTICLES.unitPrice (AVG)
    - from: PURCHASE
      to: ARTICLES.artId
    - from: PURCHASE
      to: STORES.storeId
    - from: PURCHASE
      to: PURCHASE.date
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Measures Classification**:
   - `ARTICLES.unitPrice` is classified as non-additive and renamed to `ARTICLES.unitPrice (AVG)`.

2. **Dependencies**:
   - The dependencies from the fact to each measure have been updated to reflect the new names where applicable.

3. **Structure**:
   - The overall structure remains consistent with your requirements, ensuring all necessary dependencies are included.
