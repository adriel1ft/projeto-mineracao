Here’s a refined version of the DFM schema based on your requirements:

```yaml
fact:
  name: Purchase Transactions
measures:
  - name: Total Quantity Sold (SUM)
  - name: Total Revenue (SUM)
  - name: Average Unit Price (AVG)
dependencies:
  - from: Types.TypeId
    to: Types.TypeName
  - from: Articles.ArtId
    to: Articles.ArtName
  - from: Articles.ArtId
    to: Types.TypeId
    role: Type
  - from: Regions.RegId
    to: Regions.RegionName
  - from: Regions.RegId
    to: Regions.State
  - from: Regions.State
    to: Regions.Country
  - from: Stores.StoreId
    to: Stores.StoreName
  - from: Stores.StoreId
    to: Stores.StoreAddress
  - from: Stores.StoreId
    to: Regions.RegId
    role: Region
  - from: Purchase Transactions
    to: Total Quantity Sold
  - from: Purchase Transactions
    to: Total Revenue
  - from: Purchase Transactions
    to: Average Unit Price
  - from: Purchase Transactions
    to: Articles.ArtId
  - from: Purchase Transactions
    to: Stores.StoreId
  - from: Purchase Transactions
    to: Purchase Date
descriptive:
  - name: Purchase Date
  - name: Store Name
  - name: Article Name
optional:
  - name: State
  - name: Store Address
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Intuitive Names**: Changed the fact name to "Purchase Transactions" and measures to more user-friendly names.
2. **Measure Labels**: Labeled measures as additive or non-additive. "Total Quantity Sold" and "Total Revenue" are additive, while "Average Unit Price" is non-additive.
3. **Descriptive Attributes**: Identified "Purchase Date", "Store Name", and "Article Name" as descriptive attributes.
4. **Optional Attributes**: Marked "State" and "Store Address" as optional attributes since not all regions have a state.
5. **Time Hierarchies**: Completed the time hierarchy by including "Purchase Date" as a descriptive attribute.
6. **Removed Uninteresting Attributes**: No uninteresting attributes were explicitly mentioned, but the schema was streamlined for clarity.

### Note:
The message regarding regions not having a state has been acknowledged, and the state attribute has been marked as optional to reflect this.
