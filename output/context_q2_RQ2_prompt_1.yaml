Here’s the refined DFM schema based on your input, with more intuitive names for end-users, measures labeled appropriately, and some additional adjustments:

```yaml
fact:
  name: PurchaseTransaction
measures:
  - name: TotalQuantitySold
  - name: TotalRevenueGenerated
  - name: AverageUnitPrice(AVG)
dependencies:
  - from: ProductTypes.typeId
    to: ProductTypes.typeName
  - from: Products.productId
    to: Products.productName
  - from: Products.productId
    to: ProductTypes.typeId
    role: type
  - from: Regions.regionId
    to: Regions.regionName
  - from: Regions.regionId
    to: Regions.state
  - from: Regions.state
    to: Regions.country
  - from: Stores.storeId
    to: Stores.storeName
  - from: Stores.storeId
    to: Stores.storeAddress
  - from: Stores.storeId
    to: Regions.regionId
    role: region
  - from: PurchaseTransaction
    to: TotalQuantitySold
  - from: PurchaseTransaction
    to: TotalRevenueGenerated
  - from: PurchaseTransaction
    to: AverageUnitPrice(AVG)
  - from: PurchaseTransaction
    to: Products.productId
  - from: PurchaseTransaction
    to: Stores.storeId
  - from: PurchaseTransaction
    to: PurchaseDate
descriptive:
  - name: PurchaseDate
optional:
  - name: CustomerFeedback
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Intuitive Names**: Changed the fact name to `PurchaseTransaction` and measures to `TotalQuantitySold`, `TotalRevenueGenerated`, and `AverageUnitPrice(AVG)` for clarity.
2. **Measure Labels**: Labeled `AverageUnitPrice` as non-additive by appending `(AVG)`.
3. **Descriptive Attributes**: Identified `PurchaseDate` as a descriptive attribute.
4. **Optional Attributes**: Added `CustomerFeedback` as an optional attribute.
5. **Removed Uninteresting Attributes**: Assumed that all remaining attributes are relevant based on the provided context. 

If you have specific attributes you consider uninteresting or if you want to add more details, please let me know!
