To make names more intuitive for end-users, consider the following strategies:

1. **Descriptive Naming**: Use names that clearly describe the function or purpose of the item. For example, instead of "Item1," use "UserProfileSettings."

2. **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent naming convention throughout your application. This helps users predict what a name might refer to based on their previous experiences.

3. **Avoid Jargon**: Steer clear of technical jargon or abbreviations that may not be familiar to all users. Use plain language that is easy to understand.

4. **Use Action Words**: Incorporate verbs that indicate what the user can do. For example, instead of "Reports," use "View Reports" or "Generate Report."

5. **User-Centric Language**: Consider the perspective of the end-user. Use terms that resonate with their experience and expectations.

6. **Feedback and Testing**: Gather feedback from actual users about the names you choose. Conduct usability testing to see if users understand the names without additional explanation.

7. **Short and Simple**: Keep names concise. Long names can be cumbersome and may not fit well in UI elements.

8. **Contextual Clarity**: Ensure that names make sense in the context they are used. For example, "Save" is clear in a document editor but may need more context in a settings menu.

By applying these strategies, you can create names that enhance user experience and make navigation more intuitive.
