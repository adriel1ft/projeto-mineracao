### Changes Made:
1. **Intuitive Names**: Changed the fact name to "Purchase Transactions" and measures to more user-friendly names.
2. **Measure Types**: Labeled measures as additive or non-additive, adding "(AVG)" to the average unit price.
3. **Descriptive Attributes**: Identified "Purchase Date" and "Purchase Time" as descriptive attributes.
4. **Optional Attributes**: Added "Customer Feedback" and "Discount Applied" as optional attributes.
5. **Time Hierarchies**: Added "Purchase Time" to complete the time hierarchy.
6. **Removed Uninteresting Attributes**: No uninteresting attributes were specified for removal, but the schema was streamlined for clarity.
