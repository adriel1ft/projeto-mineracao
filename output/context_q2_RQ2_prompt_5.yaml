Time hierarchies refer to the structured organization of time into various levels or categories, often used in fields such as project management, scheduling, and data analysis. Here’s a breakdown of a typical time hierarchy:

1. **Eons**: The largest division of geological time, spanning hundreds of millions to billions of years.
   - Example: Phanerozoic Eon

2. **Eras**: Subdivisions of eons, lasting tens to hundreds of millions of years.
   - Example: Mesozoic Era

3. **Periods**: Subdivisions of eras, lasting tens of millions of years.
   - Example: Jurassic Period

4. **Epochs**: Subdivisions of periods, lasting millions of years.
   - Example: Late Jurassic Epoch

5. **Ages**: The smallest standard divisions of geological time, lasting millions of years.
   - Example: Tithonian Age

In a more general context, time hierarchies can also be applied to project management or scheduling:

1. **Years**: The largest unit of time in project planning.
   - Example: 2023

2. **Quarters**: Divisions of a year, typically into four parts.
   - Example: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4

3. **Months**: Further subdivisions of quarters.
   - Example: January, February, etc.

4. **Weeks**: Subdivisions of months.
   - Example: Week 1, Week 2, etc.

5. **Days**: The smallest standard unit of time in scheduling.
   - Example: Monday, Tuesday, etc.

6. **Hours**: Further breakdown of days.
   - Example: 9 AM, 10 AM, etc.

7. **Minutes**: Subdivisions of hours.
   - Example: 30 minutes past the hour

8. **Seconds**: The smallest standard unit of time.
   - Example: 30 seconds

These hierarchies help in organizing tasks, understanding geological time scales, and managing projects effectively.
