The Dimensional Fact Model (DFM) is a design methodology used in data warehousing that focuses on organizing data into a structure that is intuitive for end-users and optimized for query performance. Here are the key features of the DFM:

1. **Fact Tables**: Central to the DFM, fact tables store quantitative data for analysis. They typically contain measurable, numerical data (facts) and foreign keys that link to dimension tables.

2. **Dimension Tables**: These tables provide context to the facts. They contain descriptive attributes (dimensions) that help to categorize and filter the data in the fact tables. Examples include time, geography, product, and customer dimensions.

3. **Star Schema**: The DFM often employs a star schema, where a central fact table is surrounded by dimension tables. This design simplifies queries and improves performance by minimizing the number of joins needed.

4. **Snowflake Schema**: An alternative to the star schema, the snowflake schema normalizes dimension tables into related sub-dimensions. This can save space but may complicate queries.

5. **Hierarchies**: Dimension tables can include hierarchies that allow users to drill down or roll up data. For example, a time dimension might include year, quarter, month, and day levels.

6. **Aggregates**: The DFM supports pre-aggregated data to improve query performance. Aggregates can be stored in separate tables or as part of the fact table.

7. **Surrogate Keys**: Instead of using natural keys from operational systems, DFM often employs surrogate keys (unique identifiers) for dimension tables to ensure consistency and performance.

8. **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)**: The DFM accommodates changes in dimension attributes over time, allowing for different strategies (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3) to manage historical data.

9. **Granularity**: The DFM emphasizes defining the granularity of the fact table, which determines the level of detail stored. This is crucial for ensuring that the data meets analytical needs.

10. **Data Integrity**: The model promotes data integrity through the use of foreign key relationships between fact and dimension tables, ensuring that all facts are associated with valid dimensions.

11. **User-Friendly**: The DFM is designed with the end-user in mind, making it easier for business users to understand and navigate the data for reporting and analysis.

12. **Performance Optimization**: The structure of the DFM is optimized for read-heavy operations, which is typical in analytical environments, allowing for faster query response times.

These features collectively make the Dimensional Fact Model a powerful approach for organizing data in a way that supports effective business intelligence and analytics.
