Here is the refined DFM schema based on your requirements:

```yaml
fact:
  name: Purchase Transactions
measures:
  - name: Total Quantity Sold (SUM)
  - name: Total Revenue Generated (SUM)
  - name: Average Unit Price (AVG)
dependencies:
  - from: Types.TypeId
    to: Types.TypeName
  - from: Articles.ArtId
    to: Articles.ArtName
  - from: Articles.ArtId
    to: Types.TypeId
    role: Type
  - from: Regions.RegId
    to: Regions.RegionName
  - from: Regions.RegId
    to: Regions.State
  - from: Regions.State
    to: Regions.Country
  - from: Purchase Transactions
    to: Total Quantity Sold

    to: Articles.ArtId
  - from: Purchase Transactions
    to: Regions.RegId
  - from: Purchase Transactions
    to: Purchase Date
descriptive:
  - name: Article Name
  - name: Region Name
  - name: State
  - name: Country
optional:
  - name: Purchase Date
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Intuitive Names**: Changed the fact name to "Purchase Transactions" and measures to more descriptive names.
2. **Measure Labels**: Labeled measures as additive or non-additive. "Total Quantity Sold" and "Total Revenue Generated" are additive, while "Average Unit Price" is non-additive.
3. **Descriptive Attributes**: Identified descriptive attributes such as Article Name, Region Name, State, and Country.
4. **Optional Attributes**: Marked "Purchase Date" as an optional attribute.
5. **Removed Uninteresting Attributes**: Removed "StoreId" from the dependencies as it was deemed uninteresting.
