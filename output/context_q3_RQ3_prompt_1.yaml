The provided context outlines a procedure for removing uninteresting attributes from a hierarchical structure, likely in a data model or a knowledge representation system. Here’s a summary of the key points:

1. **Identify the Attribute to Remove**: The attribute "b" is identified for removal, which has a parent attribute "a".

2. **Reassign Children**: All children of attribute "b" should be reassigned to become children of attribute "a". This maintains the relationships in the hierarchy.

3. **Update Dependencies**: Arcs (or connections) from "a" to all children of "b" must be added under the "dependencies" tag. This ensures that the dependencies are correctly represented after the removal.

4. **Handle Descriptive Attributes**: If any of the children of "b" are descriptive attributes, they should be removed from both the "descriptive" and "dependencies" tags. This means only the children of "b" are affected, not all descriptive attributes in the system.

5. **Initiating Removal**: The process can be initiated by expressing a lack of interest in the attribute, prompting the removal procedure.

This structured approach helps maintain the integrity of the data model while allowing for the removal of uninteresting or irrelevant attributes.
